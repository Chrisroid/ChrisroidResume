# ChrisroidResume
### Description and Features
My resume app is simply basic, it comes with the following features
* A Bottom Navigation Bar, with sleek responsive animation for your eyes
* Landscape orientation support for you, when you tilt your phone
* Support for the Following Languages, 
**Afrikaans**
**Arabic**
**Chinese**
**Spanish**
**German**
**French**
**Italian**
* Automatic Night and Dark Mode just for you, responsive to you whenever you want to switch
* The codebase is a combination of just 2 external Libraries, One for **Round Profile Picture**. another for the animation on the **Bottom Navigation Bar**
* The Design used was from my head basically, although I drew inspiration from a lot of designs, I eventuall just tried something simple
* For Now, if I had enough time, I would have made the app as responsive as possible
* Challenges I faced was that most of  the libraries for bottom nav, have implementation issues, because when android studio codebase has moved on from when they were last updated
* Another challenge was that at first the ap ran smoothly on my phone, but didnt run on appetize.io at all, I almost quit the internship, all i had to do was to make adjustments to the compile SDK version, because my phone uses a higher SDK version than appetize.io
